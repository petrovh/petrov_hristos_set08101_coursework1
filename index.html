            <h1>What is a cipher?</h1>
            <p>A cipher is a method of hiding words or text with encryption by replacing original letters with other letters, numbers and symbols through substitution or transposition.<br>A combination of substitution and transposition is also often employed. Cipher also refers to the encrypted text, cryptography system or encryption key for the original text. Encrypted text is also known as ciphertext. Plaintext is the original, unencrypted text. (Techopedia, 2018)</p>

                    <h2>Atbash Cipher</h2>
                    Atbash is a monoalphabetic substitution cipher originally used to encode the Hebrew alphabet. It can be modified for use with any known writing system with a standard collating order. The Atbash cipher is a particular type of monoalphabetic cipher formed by taking the alphabet (or abjad, syllabary, etc.) and mapping it to its reverse, so that the first letter becomes the last letter, the second letter becomes the second to last letter, and so on. Due to the fact that there is only one way to perform this, the Atbash cipher provides no communications security, as it lacks any sort of key. (Wikipedia, 2018)<br><br>

                    <h2>Caesar Cipher</h2>In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.

                    <h2>Morse Code</h2>Morse code is a method of transmitting text information as a series of on-off tones, lights, or clicks that can be directly understood by a skilled listener or observer without special equipment. It is named for Samuel F. B. Morse, an inventor of the telegraph. The International Morse Code encodes the ISO basic Latin alphabet, some extra Latin letters, the Arabic numerals and a small set of punctuation and procedural signals (prosigns) as standardized sequences of short and long signals called "dots" and "dashes", or "dits" and "dahs", as in amateur radio practice.
