        <div class="parallax"></div>
        <p>This is the first paralax image. It is in it's full size.</p>
        <div class="parallax2"></div>
        <p>This is the second paralax image used. It has a minimum height of 35 per cent.</p>
        <div class="parallax-ac"></div>
        <p>This is the image used for the atbash cipher parallax.</p>
        <div class="parallax-cc"></div>
        <p>This is the image used for the caesar cipher parallax.</p>
        <div class="parallax-mc"></div>
        <p>This is the image used for the morse code parallax.</p>
        <br>
        <p>All of the parallaxes have a value of 0.9 opacity. The parallaxes in the pages where the enciphering and deciphering is taking place are with a minimum height of 25%, althought they don't really serve as parallaxes in those pages, and rather as banners, or even image backgrounds. In addition, all of the paralaxes (except the second one in the main page) have a title within them. It is represented by a black box with white text inside it, the text has 10px letter spacing. The font size is 30pt. Each box is in the center of the correspoding parallax image. Here is an example:</p>
        <br>
        <div class="title-design">
            <span class="border-design">EXAMPLE</span>
            <br>
            <h1>h1 headers</h1>
            <p>The first header is an h1 header, done so to stand out and to catch more attention. It is followed by a regular paragraph answering the questions the header asks - "what is a cipher".</p>
            <h2>h2 headers</h2>
            <p>There are three h2 headers in the main page, there are above three paragraphs. The headers represent the names of the ciphers, and the paragraphs below are their descriptions.</p>
            <a href="#">A link</a>
            <p>Links have four states. The link and visited one have none text decoration, while when the link is being hovered over or active it is underlined. The links used are plain text.</p>
            <button class="button">Buttons</button>
            <p>The buttons used in the website are mostly for encoding or decoding text. They have a normal state and a hoover state. They have the same font, which is used across the website. Their border is 3px and black, the text inside is also in that colour. They have no background and the text size is 12pt. On mouse hover the buttons become black with white text inside. Their lenght is double their height.</p>
            <textarea rows="7" cols="50"></textarea>
            <p>The text areas have a black border, and are non-resizible. The first one in which the text has to be placed in order to encifer or decifer it is autofocused when the page is loaded, and it requires text in order for the function to run, while the second one is a read only box.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Divisions</p>
            <div class="row">
            <div class="para">There are several divisions in the website.</div>
                <div class="para">The footer vertically aligns different paragraphs.</div>
                <div class="para">The others usually have a margin or a padding, to keep the contents away from the borders of the webpage or the division itself.</div>
            </div>
            <br>
            <p>Text</p>
            <p>Text across the website is in the Playfair Display font, the text is in black colour.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The websites aligment is centered.</p>
        </div>
